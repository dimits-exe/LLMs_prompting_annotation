# LLMs, LLM Prompting and Annotation

This repository houses several Practical Data Science assignements relating to LLM Prompting (use cases, modern prompting techniques, fail conditions).

1. [ChatGPT prompting fail cases](chatgpt/chatgpt-python-prompt.ipynb) where we explore two cases of ChatGPT code generation failing.

2. [LLM prompting for annotation](annotation/annotation.ipynb) where we leverage LLMs to help us in a difficult annotation task, which we then handle by using pandas
