# LLMs, Prompting, NLP and Annotation

This repository houses several Practical Data Science assignements relating to LLM Prompting (use cases, modern prompting techniques, fail conditions).

The repository is organized as follows:

1. [ChatGPT prompting fail cases](chatgpt/chatgpt-python-prompt.ipynb) where we explore two cases of ChatGPT code generation failing.

2. [LLM prompting for annotation](annotation/annotation.ipynb) where we leverage LLMs to help us in a difficult annotation task, which we then handle by using pandas.

3. [Annotation analysis](ann_stats/ann_stats.ipynb) where we analyze the clustering between different annotators.

4. [Secure-GPT](secure-gpt/SecureGPT_HW4.pptx) a group presentation for a new LLM use-case to make the internet safer - includes fake data generation for demonstration purposes.

5. [Webscraping](webscraping/scraping.ipynb) where we create a webscraper for a Greek gaming forum.

6. [Greek Embedding Plot](embedding-plot/plot.ipynb), in which we create an interquartile range for all the posts in a Greeklish2Greek dataset.

7. [Greek Embedding Creation](greek_embedding/greek_embeddings.ipynb) in which we create and test our own Greek Embeddings.
