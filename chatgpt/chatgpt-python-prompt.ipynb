    "        The TIN is initially checked to ensure it consists of exactly 9 digits.\n",
    "        It is also confirmed that the TIN contains only numeric digits (0-9).\n",

    "        The last digit of the TIN (the 9th digit) is separated and temporarily removed for later verification.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Iterate Over the First 8 Digits:\n",
    "        The program loops through the first 8 digits of the TIN (indices 0 to 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Partial Sum Calculation:\n",
    "        For each digit, it adds the digit to the running total.\n",
    "        If the current digit is at an even position (0-based indexing, so 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th digits), it multiplies the digit by 2.\n",
    "        If the result of this multiplication is greater than 4, it subtracts 9 from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Calculate Verification Digit:\n",
    "        After processing all 8 digits, we have a total that includes the sum of the digits as per the algorithm.\n",
    "        The calculated verification digit is determined as the remainder of total when divided by 10.\n",
    "        If the remainder is 0, the calculated verification digit is set to 10 (in accordance with the Greek TIN validation rules).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Comparison:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a Greek TIN: 123456789.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The program checks that it consists of 9 digits.\n",
    "    It separates the verification digit (9) and temporarily removes it.\n",
    "    The calculation starts with a total of 0.\n",
    "    It iterates through the first 8 digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).\n",
    "    It adds the digits to total and applies the rules for even-indexed digits (e.g., 2 * 2 = 4, but since it's greater than 4, subtract 9 to get -5).\n",
    "    The total becomes 1 + 4 - 2 + 8 - 4 + 6 - 6 + 7 = 14.\n",
    "    The calculated verification digit is 14 % 10 = 4.\n",
    "    The calculated verification digit (4) is compared to the original 9th digit (9), and they don't match, so this TIN would be considered invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a valid TIN, the calculated verification digit should match the original 9th digit.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
