# Practical Data Science - Assignment 2

### Dimitris Tsirmpas

## Methodology

The annotation was performed in the following steps:

1. Import the xlsx file into jupyter notebook
2. Assign a relatively specific label to each proverb
3. Use the pandas library to view common labels and organize the dataset
4. Group specific labels to more general labels
5. Automatically assign each distinct label (cluster) to an integer from 1 to 10
6. Export the integer labels to the xlsx file and fill in cluster descriptions


## Difficulties:

- The dataset was extremely uncommon (non common Greek dialects) which meant traditional ML methods for text such as LDA 
could not be used.
- The proverbs were at times difficult to understand, forcing us to use the "none" label when classification was extermely unreliable
- Some proverbs shared multiple clusters, fuzzy clustering may have been preferred in order to accurately convey their meaning


## Possible future improvements

- Use multi-label annotation (fuzzy clustering) to more accurately convey the proverbs' meaning
- Perhaps use simple NLP algorithms to estimate (even with low confidence) the subject of a proverb, speeding up annotation
- Documenting the decisions we took for hard-to-classify proverbs
- Include pandas code in order for future annotators to be able to easily visualize / manage the dataset
